Everything should be working properly. Sometimes I get this message when I enter "make" in the command line: 

In file included from <command-line>:0:0:
/usr/include/stdc-predef.h:1:0: fatal error: canâ€™t create precompiled header worker: Text file busy
 /* Copyright (C) 1991-2012 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 ^
compilation terminated.
Preprocessed source stored into /tmp/ccCqZROP.out file, please attach this to your bugreport.

Runs when I enter "make" a second time after getting this message

To know how to run the project: 
./oss -h 

To run the project if you want to skip the help message:
1) make
2) ./oss -s # -n # -t #  

^ (-s, -n, -t can be in any order) ^

Project details (for me to look back on):

Creating a simulated system clock and wrote it to shared memory

Fork children from oss to worker (given how many run simultaneously by user)and have them read the time from shared memory

Loop for a random amount of time, sec and nanosec (within the bounds of user input), that was passed into worker

Output information detailing the child(ren) process in oss every half a second until all have terminated or time has surpassed 60 seconds
